<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer programmers are responsible for writing code that allows many different types of computer programs to function properly. They turn the program designs created by software developers and engineers into instructions that a computer can follow. They use <i>programming languages</i> to tell the computer what to do. Popular languages include SQL, Java, C#, C++ and Python. A typical work environment for a programmer could be an office, although as long as they have a computer, technically they could work anywhere. Important tools for a programmer are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Computer</li>
    <li>Internet</li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> (Program to write and compile code in)</li>
    <li>Language API (Notes on a particular language’s syntax, such as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/">Java</a>)</li>
    <li>Curly brackets. Lots of them.</li>
  </ul>
 Pay Range: $39,000 (10th percentile) to $90,000 (90th percentile)<br>

 <!-- How to become one-->

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;To become a computer programmer, most people go to a four-year university and major in computer science. However, experience is what counts, so it’s important to write with multiple languages. Being able to solve problems is the basis of programming, which means that working with other systems can really improve skills. For example, I have written code in Python, Java and C++. I have also worked with a navigational gyro/sensor board called the NavX through my robotics team. Other educational opportunities could be taking classes or doing programming competitions.

<!-- Why I chose this career -->
<h3><a id="why-i-chose" class="anchor" href="index.html" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><font face = "Courier">Why I Chose This Career</font></h3>
<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be a computer programmer because I love computers and solving problems. I started working with them at the age of three, when my dad began to teach me about hardware. Since then, I’ve taught myself to fix electronics, starting with iPods and moving onto larger devices. We are so dependent on computers today that I think it’s very important to understand how they work. In addition, making a program work or solving a problem is a fun challenge, and it’s really cool to watch your code run, whether it’s in Eclipse’s console or on a real life robot.
